# Four Summers as "Temporary Locals" in Europe

In August 2019 Caroline and Chris Simpkins finally settled into their new home in the Fainview Farm subdivision of Chattahoochee Plantation after returning from a summer in Berlin, Germany.  Chris taught computer science courses (software design and machine learning) and co-directed the inaugural offering of Georgia Tech’s summer study abroad program at Technische Universität Berlin.  Caroline taught the undergraduate health requirement and a special topics course on the neurological benefits of exercise.  It was their fourth summer in a row living temporarily in Europe, after spending the previous three summers in Metz, France while Chris taught at Georgia Tech Lorraine.  They have many deep connections to Europe and made the most of their four summers there.  They hope to share some tips and insights that help you plan your own visit to Europe.

## Paris, France

Metz, France is less than 1.5 hours from Paris by high high-speed rail, the TGV (train grande vitesse).  Thanks to this easy access they spent about a dozen weekends and nights in Paris over their three summers in France.  Caroline is a former principal ballerina with The Georgia Ballet and Chris has become quite a fan himself, so it's appropriate that their very first experience in Paris would be seeing every ballerina's favorite ballet, Giselle, performed by The Paris Opera Ballet in the world famous Palais Garnier.  It's also appropriate that on this very fist weekend excursion they dealt with one of the most frustrating realities of living in or visiting France -- train strikes.  Luckily they had a car for the summer, but it meant that Caroline had to arrange parking for the weekend -- no small feat in a European city -- and Chris had to teach a full day and then drive to Paris instead of relaxing on the TGV.  Also, the TGV travels at 320 KPH (200 MPH), nearly 200 KPH faster than the highest speed limits on French highways, and YOU DO NOT SPEED in Europe -- there are speed cameras everywhere!  (And, yes, Christopher "Andretti" got a speeding ticket while in France -- like he has everywhere he's ever lived!)  So after a beautiful drive through the countryside capped by a harrowing drive through the chaotic streets of Paris, they made it to the opera house just as the doors closed.  Even after the stress of the trip, the performance and the venue were transcendent, so much that they returned to see the performance a second time a couple of weeks later.

There are several iconic sights that you must see if you've never been to Paris -- The Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower -- but if you have time to see more, see a performance at Palais Garnier, whether it's an opera or a ballet.  If you don't see a performance, do a guided tour of Palais Garnier during the day.  The outside is beautiful, but the inside is absolutely breathtaking and the history is very interesting.  In addition to the Palais Garnier, Chris and Caroline loved the Musée D'Orsay, Musée Rodin, Theatre du Chatelet where they caught New York City Ballet on tour dancing Balanchine, Theatre de Chaillot where they saw Netherlands Dance Theatre (are you seeing a pattern?) and sipped champagne at intermission with a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower, and enjoyed just walked around meeting people and enjoying the atmosphere.

### Chris's and Caroline's personal tips for visiting Paris

- Learn enough French to say basic polite greetings but understand that most Parisians will quickly switch to English even if your French is outstanding (their English is probably better!).  Outside of Paris you're far less likely to find strong English speakers.
- At restaurants, order everything you need at the beginning of the meal -- you're unlikely to see the waiter until it's time for dessert or a cheese plate.  Order a carafe d'eau (pitcher of water for the table) and prefer sharing a bottle of wine to ordering individual glasses.
- Make reservations for restaurants.  You might be able to get a seat at a good restaurant for lunch, but almost never for dinner.  Many restaurants in Europe are on Open Table.
- Put your wallet deep in your front pocket and clutch any backpacks or purses close to your chest on the Métro (subway) -- you **will** be targeted by pick-pocketers.
- Be vigilant for thieves working together, for example someone offering you a dollar bill that you "dropped" or a child asking you to sign a petition.  Yell at them to go away and don't bother to be polite.  We have it on good authority that waving a walking cane at them can be effective.
- If you see a liquid streaming down the sidewalk as you're walking, step over it -- it might not be water.

## Provence, France

You could visit Marseille for a city experience, but the countryside and small villages are Chris's and Caroline's favorite -- endless fields of lavender, the world famous vineyards of Chateauneuf-du-Pâpe, and small towns on the Mediterranean coast like Cassis.  Cassis is a charming little town best known for its calanques -- inlets formed by steep rocky cliffs which you can tour by boat.  Chris's and Caroline's friends, who recently moved from Aix-en-Provence to the countryside near Rognes, have a boat which they dock in Toulon.  They've taken the boat to the Poquerolles Islands and Port Cros, stopping along the way to bask in the mediterranean sun and dive of cliffs.  Port Cros is famous for a fish caught in the deep sea, "les beaux yeux" (big/beautiful eyes), so named for the large eyes typical of fish who inhabit the darkness of the deep sea.  It's not Chris's and Caroline's favorite, but it's nonetheless enjoyable on a warm sunny day with a cold bottle of french rosé, which they didn't know they liked until they had rosé from Provence!

### Chris's and Caroline's tips for visiting Provence

- Cassis isn't easy to reach, but well worth the effort.  They took a train to the Cassis train station and walked the 3 KM to the beach -- not too bad on the way down, but not fun on the way back.  Be smarter and take a car or bus.
- If you visit during the summer, book a hotel or AirBnB with an air conditioner.  Most Europeans, even in the very hot south of France, still don't use air conditioning.  Check TripAdvisor or AirBnB reviews specifically for air conditioning -- many places will advertise air conditioning that turns out to be ineffective or unreliable in reality.

## Annecy, France


Annecy is called the "Venice of the Alps" for the rivers and canals that run through the town.


## Switzerland and Southern Germany


Chris and Caroline have German friends whose work brought them to Switzerland.  Olaf is an engineer and Minu is a teacher and, quite luckily, a part-time tour guide with Best of Switzerland tours in Zürich.  Switzerland, and the Alps in general, are breathtaking.  It looks as if a computer rendering went too far and created an unrealistic image but it's very real and you just have to experience it in person.  Chris and Caroline especially liked going on a tour of Jungfraujoch, the highest point in Europe reachable without mountaineering, many of their frends and Chris's students loved the adventure tourism in Switzerland -- hang-gliding, hiking, paragliding, and so on.

## Hamburg, Germany

Hamburg is cooler.

## Berlin, Germany

Berlin is cool.
